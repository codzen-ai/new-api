# AGENTS.md — Project Conventions for new-api

## Overview

This is an AI API gateway/proxy built with Go. It aggregates 40+ upstream AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Azure, AWS Bedrock, etc.) behind a unified API, with user management, billing, rate limiting, and an admin dashboard.

This repo is codzen-ai's fork of `QuantumNous/new-api`. `staging` carries the fork's own commits on top of upstream `main` and is rebased onto it (`.claude/skills/rebase-staging`); `production` points at a `staging` commit verified in the staging environment.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go 1.26 for the root module and `tokenkit/`, Go 1.25.1 for `relaykit/` (see each module’s `go.mod`), Gin web framework, GORM v2 ORM
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Rsbuild 2, TanStack Router/Query/Table, Zustand, Base UI, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL for the primary database (the upstream code also carries SQLite and MySQL branches, which this fork does not need); a separately configured log database also supports ClickHouse
- **Cache**: Redis (go-redis) + in-memory cache
- **Auth**: Browser sessions, API tokens and personal access tokens, JWT, WebAuthn/Passkeys, TOTP, OAuth/OIDC; Casbin authorization in `service/authz/`
- **Extensions**: JavaScript task plugins executed by moejs; Electron desktop wrapper
- **Frontend package manager**: Bun (preferred over npm/yarn/pnpm)

## Architecture

- The Go gateway handles management APIs, upstream relay, billing, and background tasks across `router/`, `middleware/`, `controller/`, `service/`, `model/`, and `relay/`.
- `relaykit/` is an independent Go module for protocol DTOs and conversions; transport, authentication, database access, and billing stay in the host.
- `tokenkit/` is an independent Go module for text and image token counting and estimation; request parsing, file loading, and billing stay in the host.
- JavaScript task plugins live in `plugins/tasks/`, run through `pkg/jsplugin/`, and integrate with host task polling and settlement.
- `web/` is the React frontend (see `web/AGENTS.md`); `electron/` is the desktop wrapper.

## Internationalization (i18n)

### Backend (`i18n/`)
- Library: `nicksnyder/go-i18n/v2`
- Languages: en, zh-CN, zh-TW
- Scope: text with no web console in between (errors returned to AI clients, emails, notifications), translated with `i18n.T` / `i18n.Translate`
- Web console API messages are English source text built with `common.NewMessage` / `common.ApiErrorT` / `common.ApiSuccessT`; the frontend translates them, so add each key to all seven frontend locale files
- Stored log content is `[]*common.Message`; a fail reason written by the gateway is a fixed English sentence that is also a key in the frontend locale files
- Server log lines are English text passed through `common.LogText`; `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=zh-CN` prints the Chinese text of the lines that have one in `common/log_text.zh-CN.json`, and is the language of backend messages for a reader who states none

### Frontend (`web/src/i18n/`)
- Library: `i18next` + `react-i18next` + `i18next-browser-languagedetector`
- Languages: en (base), zh (fallback), zh-TW, fr, ru, ja, vi
- Translation files: `web/src/i18n/locales/{lang}.json` — flat JSON, keys are English source strings
- Usage: `useTranslation()` hook, call `t('English key')` in components
- CLI tools: `bun run i18n:sync` (from `web/`)

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

GitHub Issues in `codzen-ai/new-api` (never upstream `QuantumNous/new-api`), via `gh`: a spec is an issue labelled `spec`, its tickets are its sub-issues linked by native `blocked by` dependencies. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default five-role vocabulary (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root, created lazily by `/domain-modeling`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Rules

### Common Code Quality

- New code should stay direct and readable. Prefer early returns, clear branches, and well-named local variables to deep nesting or layered control flow.
- Minimize nested function definitions. Use them only when required by a callback API or when keeping the closure local is clearly simpler than adding another symbol.
- Avoid adding package-level or module-level helper functions that have only one caller and do not express a stable business concept. Inline that logic at the call site instead.
- A separate function is appropriate when it represents reusable behavior, a required interface/framework callback, an exported API, a test fixture, or complex business logic that deserves direct tests.
- If a single-use helper is kept, its name must describe a durable domain concept rather than a mechanical step extracted only to shorten the caller.

### Authentication Security (OWASP Mandatory)

- Any implementation, modification, or review involving authentication-related flows MUST comply with the applicable requirements of the latest stable [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) and the relevant [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/). This applies to both backend and frontend changes, including registration, login/logout, password changes and recovery, email verification, MFA, WebAuthn/Passkeys, OAuth/OIDC, account linking/unlinking, sessions, JWTs, API credentials, and re-authentication for sensitive actions.
- Before changing these flows, read the applicable OWASP guidance, starting with the [Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html) and [Session Management Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html). Consult the password storage, forgot password, MFA, OAuth, and CSRF guidance when those mechanisms are involved. Identify the applicable controls before implementation; existing code is not a justification for retaining or introducing an insecure pattern.
- Enforce security controls on the server. Apply the relevant requirements for credential storage and transport, resistance to account enumeration and brute force, CSRF and replay protection, token/challenge expiry and single use where required, protocol-specific verification, session rotation and invalidation, and re-authentication for sensitive account changes. Frontend checks MUST NOT substitute for server-side enforcement, and recovery or alternative login paths MUST NOT bypass the required authentication assurance.
- Authentication audit events MUST exclude passwords, verification codes, recovery codes, private keys, and usable session or authentication tokens. Record enough non-secret context to investigate authentication failures and sensitive account changes.
- Verify affected security controls with focused regression tests, including applicable failure, expiry, replay, and bypass cases, following the existing backend/frontend test conventions. Record the OWASP references (including the ASVS version and requirement IDs when used), validation performed, and any unresolved gaps in the change summary or PR description. Do not claim compliance or completion while an applicable security requirement remains unmet or unverified.

### Backend Rules

**Modern Go conventions:** Apply these conventions to new or modified Go code, including tests and `relaykit/`, when they preserve behavior and improve readability. Use the Go version declared in the relevant module's `go.mod` as the compatibility baseline.

- Use `any` instead of `interface{}`, including map values, slice elements, parameters, and return types.
- For fixed-count loops, prefer `for i := range n`, or `for range n` when the index is unused. For slice indices, prefer `for i := range items`. Keep conventional loops when the bound changes during iteration or the loop needs a different start or step.
- When split results are only traversed once without indexing or reuse, prefer `strings.SplitSeq` or `bytes.SplitSeq` over allocating a slice with `Split`.
- Use `strings.Cut` when splitting at the first separator, and `strings.CutPrefix` / `strings.CutSuffix` when checking and removing a prefix or suffix. Avoid separate searches and manual slicing for the same operation.
- Use `slices.Contains` / `slices.ContainsFunc` for membership checks and `slices.Sort` for natural ordering of ordered element types instead of equivalent hand-written loops or sort callbacks.
- Use `maps.Copy` for shallow map copies and merges. Initialize the destination as needed, and preserve nil-versus-empty behavior and the order in which later values overwrite earlier ones. It does not replace a deep copy.
- Use built-in `min` / `max` for simple bounds instead of equivalent conditional assignments. Preserve numeric semantics; these functions do not prevent overflow in their arguments or replace billing validation and safe quota conversion.
- Use `strings.Builder` for repeated string concatenation in loops; retain direct concatenation for simple fixed expressions.
- Use `reflect.TypeFor[T]()` when the type is known statically, and `reflect.Pointer` instead of `reflect.Ptr`. Keep `reflect.TypeOf` when the dynamic type of a value is required.
- Prefer `sync.WaitGroup.Go` for the standard `Add(1)` / goroutine / deferred `Done()` pattern when its lifecycle and panic contract apply. Preserve existing recovery behavior; the function passed to `Go` must not panic.
- Remove redundant loop-variable copies such as `tc := tc` when they exist only for pre-Go-1.22 closure capture. Retain copies needed for actual snapshot semantics or variables assigned outside the loop.
- Remove ineffective `omitempty` tags on non-pointer struct fields only after confirming the active JSON encoder preserves the same output. Do not change field types or omission behavior as part of a style cleanup; optional relay scalar fields must still follow the pointer rules below.
- Format modified Go files with `gofmt` and remove unused imports after these changes.

**relaykit and tokenkit module independence:** The `relaykit/` and `tokenkit/` Go modules MUST remain independently buildable.

- Code under `relaykit/` or `tokenkit/` MUST NOT import or depend on packages from the root `new-api` module, or rely on root-only configuration, generated files, or workspace wiring. `tokenkit/` also MUST NOT depend on `relaykit/`.
- Any change affecting `relaykit/`, `tokenkit/`, or their public APIs MUST be verified with `GOWORK=off go build ./...` inside that module; a successful root-module build is not sufficient.

**JSON package:** In the root Go module, all JSON marshal/unmarshal operations MUST use the wrapper functions in `common/json.go`:

- `common.Marshal(v any) ([]byte, error)`
- `common.Unmarshal(data []byte, v any) error`
- `common.UnmarshalJsonStr(data string, v any) error`
- `common.DecodeJson(reader io.Reader, v any) error`
- `common.GetJsonType(data json.RawMessage) string`

Do NOT directly import or call `encoding/json` in business code. `json.RawMessage`, `json.Number`, and other type definitions from `encoding/json` may still be referenced as types, but actual marshal/unmarshal calls must go through `common.*`.

Inside `relaykit/`, use `kitutil.*` from `relaykit/relayconvert/kitutil/json.go`, never host `common`. Direct encoder calls belong only in codec implementations.

**Database:** This fork runs PostgreSQL only. Database code MUST work on PostgreSQL; SQLite and MySQL support is not required.

- Any change that can affect database behavior MUST be verified before the work is considered complete. This includes ORM/database-driver dependency changes, connection/DSN/protocol or prepared-statement configuration, models and GORM tags, migrations and `AutoMigrate`, constraints and indexes, `Scanner`/`Valuer`/serializer behavior, raw SQL, transactions, and row locking.
- Required database verification MUST exercise a real PostgreSQL instance. Unit tests, mocks, a successful build, or code inspection are not substitutes.
- Treat GORM core and its PostgreSQL driver as a compatible version set: a change to one of them requires checking upstream compatibility and running the PostgreSQL verification.
- Schema or migration changes MUST be tested both on a fresh database and by upgrading a representative database in the shape `production` runs. Run startup/migration at least twice to prove idempotency, and verify that existing data, indexes, constraints, and uniqueness guarantees are preserved. Cover the separately configured log database when the affected path is shared with or used by it.
- Record the PostgreSQL version, commands, and results in the final handoff or pull request. If the verification cannot be run, report the blocker explicitly and do not claim the change is complete.
- Prefer GORM methods (`Create`, `Find`, `Where`, `Updates`, etc.) over raw SQL.
- Let GORM handle primary key generation; do not use `SERIAL` directly.
- Standard `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` row locks built with GORM query methods in `model/` MUST use `lockForUpdate(tx)`. Do not use the legacy GORM v1 pattern `tx.Set("gorm:query_option", "FOR UPDATE")`, because GORM v2 silently ignores it and no lock is acquired.
- In raw SQL, quote columns as `"column"`, and use `commonGroupCol`, `commonKeyCol` from `model/main.go` for reserved-word columns like `group` and `key`.
- Leave the existing cross-database branches and helpers (`commonTrueVal`/`commonFalseVal`, `common.UsingMainDatabase(...)`, `common.UsingLogDatabase(...)`, the SQLite/MySQL paths in migrations) in place, and keep using them in code that already does, so rebases onto upstream stay clean. New code of the fork's own may use PostgreSQL directly.

**Relay and provider behavior:**

- When implementing a new channel, confirm whether the provider supports `StreamOptions`; if supported, add the channel to `streamSupportedChannels`.
- For request structs parsed from client JSON and re-marshaled to upstream providers, optional scalar fields MUST use pointer types with `omitempty` (for example, `*int`, `*uint`, `*float64`, `*bool`).
- Preserve explicit zero values in upstream relay request DTOs: absent client JSON fields must become `nil` and be omitted, while explicit `0`, `0.0`, or `false` values must remain non-`nil` and be sent upstream.
- Avoid non-pointer scalars with `omitempty` for optional request parameters, because zero values will be silently dropped during marshal.

**JavaScript task plugins (mandatory):**

- Before implementing, modifying, or reviewing JavaScript task plugins or their host API/runtime, MUST read [Task Plugin API v1](docs/plugin-api/v1.md), including its description writing and translation conventions. When changing the plugin contract, also check `docs/plugin-api/v1.schema.json` and `docs/plugin-api/v1.d.ts` for consistency.
- For numeric billing fields in `usageSchema` and `usageProfiles[].schema`, `description` MUST name the **billing subject + unit price**, because it labels the price input in the UI. For example, `image_count` uses `Image generation unit price` / `图片生成单价`, not `Generated image count` / `生成图片张数`; `seconds` uses `Video generation unit price` / `视频生成单价`. The field value remains a usage quantity, not a price.
- Put units in `unit`. Keep protocol limits, usage sources, defaults, estimation, and settlement details in code comments or technical documentation. Descriptions must be short, equivalent across languages, and free of numeric prices and trailing punctuation. Follow the API document's separate wording rules for actions, booleans, and other enum conditions.
- Review metadata wording explicitly before completing plugin work. These are authoring requirements; successful compilation, schema validation, or tests do not verify that descriptions follow them.

**Billing rules (mandatory read gate):** `.agents/rules/billing.md` holds the billing conventions (expression system, built-in pricing, safety invariants, deriving billable quantities from upstream responses). If a task touches billing as defined below, you MUST read that file in full with your file-read tool — not a grep, a partial skim, memory, or a summary — before planning, coding, or reviewing, and then follow every rule in it. A task touches billing when it meets any of these:

- Edits `pkg/billingexpr/`, `setting/billing_setting/`, `common/quota_math.go`, `types/price_data.go`, `relay/request_billing.go`, `relay/image_handler.go`, `relay/relay_task.go`, `relay/helper/price.go`, `relay/helper/billing_expr_request.go`, `relay/helper/valid_request.go`, `service/quota.go`, `service/text_quota.go`, `service/image_billing.go`, `service/tiered_settle.go`, `service/task_billing.go`, `service/responses_usage.go`, the billing part of `service/log_info_generate.go`, the `model/pricing*.go` / `model/model_pricing*.go` files, or the billing fields and methods of `relay/common/relay_info.go` (`PriceData`, `TieredBillingSnapshot`, `BillingImageCount`, `UpdateImageCount`).
- Reads or writes `PriceData` / `OtherRatios`, quota pre-consume, settlement, refund, or consume-log billing fields anywhere else.
- Derives a billable quantity or `Usage` from an upstream response or stream (image counts, seconds, tokens, task deductions) in any channel adaptor, response handler, or task plugin.
- Validates, bounds, or forwards a request field that becomes a billing multiplier (`n`, `max_tokens`-family fields, duration, resolution or quality, batch counts), including passthrough and multipart paths.
- Adds or changes model prices, or numeric `usageSchema` / `usageProfiles[].schema` fields in a task plugin.

Tasks that touch none of these (for example unrelated frontend work, authentication, database migrations, or protocol conversion that leaves usage untouched) do not need to read it.

**Backend test quality:** Backend tests must protect real behavior, API contracts, billing/accounting invariants, data compatibility, or regression paths.

- **Do not scatter tests for a small change:** For a focused feature or fix, extend an existing suitable test file first. If a new test file is necessary, add at most one and consolidate the key regression cases there. MUST NOT create separate test files for the same small feature across `controller/`, `service/`, `setting/`, or other layers merely because its call chain crosses those layers. Do not repeat fixtures and assertions at each layer. Keep the cases compact and focused on observable behavior; the number of production files touched is not a reason to add more test files.
- Do not add tests that only improve coverage numbers, prove that code happens to run, or lock in implementation details without a user-visible or cross-module contract.
- Avoid fake fuzz/stress/smoke/performance tests built from random inputs, large loop counts, sleeps, timing comparisons, or log-only assertions.
- Avoid duplicate tests that exercise the same branch with different names but no new invariant.
- Avoid tests that force incorrect provider/protocol semantics into production code.
- Avoid tests that assert private constants, select-field lists, helper internals, or file layout when observable behavior is already covered elsewhere.
- Prefer deterministic table tests with explicit inputs and exact expected outputs.
- When tests need database, request context, user group, settings, or cache state, initialize that state explicitly inside the test fixture.
- New or substantially rewritten Go backend tests MUST use `github.com/stretchr/testify/require` for setup and fatal assertions, and `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert` for non-fatal value checks.
- Avoid hand-written assertion helpers unless they encode a reusable project-specific invariant.
- When cleaning tests, preserve meaningful regression coverage. If a deleted test covered a real contract indirectly, replace it with a smaller test that asserts that contract directly.

**Documentation files:**

- Add files under `docs/` only when the user asks for them or the agent workflow writes them (`docs/agents/`, `docs/adr/`, and `GLOSSARY.md` at the repo root).
- Do NOT create or generate documentation files in this repository's plugin directories under `plugins/`, including `plugins/tasks/<plugin>/` and their subdirectories. This includes README files, changelogs, usage guides, and other documentation files, regardless of format.

### Frontend Rules

- **Reuse existing UI components first (mandatory):** Before implementing or changing frontend UI, read `web/AGENTS.md` and the project `shadcn-ui` skill, search `web/src/components/` and the relevant feature for existing components, and read matching implementations and call sites. Do not start from custom markup or registry installation without checking the repository first.
- Prefer the project's shared business components over lower-level UI primitives when they cover the use case. Evaluate existing props, composition, and a compatible extension before introducing a replacement. Importing `Button` or `AlertDialog` does not satisfy this rule if the same behavior is already provided by a shared component such as `CopyButton` or `ConfirmDialog`.
- New implementations of common UI behavior require a concrete capability gap: identify the existing candidates and explain why reuse, composition, or a compatible extension is unsuitable in the change summary or PR description. Different text, dimensions, colors, or feature location alone do not justify duplication. Feature components may compose shared components with business data and actions. Follow the reuse workflow and component entry points in `web/AGENTS.md`; generic library or registry guidance does not override this project-specific priority.
- Use `bun` as the preferred package manager and script runner for the frontend (`web/`):
  - `bun install` for dependency installation
  - `bun run dev` for development server
  - `bun run build` for production build
  - `bun run i18n:*` for i18n tooling
- Frontend UI text must support i18n with `i18next`/`react-i18next`. Use flat JSON locale files in `web/src/i18n/locales/{lang}.json`, with English source strings as keys.
- In React components, use `useTranslation()` and call `t('English key')` for user-facing text.
- **Number formatting and Intl locales (mandatory):** Reuse `@/lib/format` for ordinary number/compact-number display and `@/lib/currency` for monetary values; preserve each formatter's precision and unit semantics. Interface language codes such as `zhCN` / `zhTW` are NOT valid Intl locales. Any interface language passed to `Intl.*`, `toLocaleString` / `toLocaleDateString` / `toLocaleTimeString`, or a locale-aware formatting helper MUST first pass through `toIntlLocale` from `@/i18n/languages`. Do not duplicate language mappings or pass raw language codes through aliases. Follow `web/AGENTS.md` for the lint rule and regression requirements.
- Follow `web/AGENTS.md` for detailed frontend conventions, including TypeScript, component structure, styling, accessibility, testing, and build checks.

### Project Governance

**Upstream attribution:** This fork of `QuantumNous/new-api` is licensed under AGPLv3, with additional terms in `NOTICE`. Keep what the license requires:

- `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and upstream copyright notices stay intact.
- The UI keeps the attribution "Frontend design and development by New API contributors." and a visible link to https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api in a prominent about, legal, footer, or attribution location.
- The fork does not misrepresent the origin of the software, and marks its changes as AGPLv3 Section 7(c) requires.

Beyond that, the fork may rename, rebrand, or remove upstream references in its own UI and docs. Keep the Go module path and import paths as upstream has them, so rebases onto upstream stay clean.

**Issues and pull requests:** Specs, tickets, and pull requests go to `codzen-ai/new-api` only, never to `QuantumNous/new-api`; `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` describes how. `.agents/github/ISSUE.md`, `.agents/github/PR.md`, and the `.github/` issue and PR templates are upstream's and do not apply. A PR body says what changed and why, carries the `Closes #<n>` lines that `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` lists, and reports verification as the commands actually run and their observed results.
